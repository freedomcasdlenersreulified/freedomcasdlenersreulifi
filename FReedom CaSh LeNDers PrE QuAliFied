Cash advances are an easy way to get cash fast, but they often come with hefty fees that outweigh any benefits. Before you take out a cash advance, review the terms so you’re aware of the high charges you’ll likely incur.

Cash advance APR: Cash advances carry a separate, and often higher, interest rate than purchases or balance transfers. For example, the Citi® Double Cash Card has a 0% intro APR on balance transfers for 18 months. After that, the variable APR will be 18.99% - 28.99%, but a 29.99% variable APR for cash advances. (see rates and fees.)
    Cash advance fee: Your card issuer often charges a cash advance fee, which is typically 3% or 5% of the total amount of each cash advance you request. For example, a $250 cash advance with a 5% fee will cost you $12.50.
ATM or bank fee: If you use an ATM or visit a bank, you can expect a fee for taking out a cash advance.
    No grace period: Cash advances don’t benefit from a grace period. That means you will be charged interest starting from the date you withdraw a cash advance. That’s different from when you make a purchase with you card, and the issuer offers a grace period of at least 21 days where you won’t incur interest if your balance is paid in full by the due date.
Separate credit limit: Cash advances often have a separate credit limit that’s a portion of your overall credit limit. You may only be able to take out a few hundred dollars.
