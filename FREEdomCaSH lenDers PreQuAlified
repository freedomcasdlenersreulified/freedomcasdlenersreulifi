A cash advance may seem like an easy way to get cash fast, but it can cost you a lot of money in interest and fees. Before you take out a cash advance, familiarize yourself with the terms, so you’re not hit with an unpleasant surprise. And better yet, avoid a cash advance altogether.

Below, CNBC Select reviews the basics of a cash advance: what it is, the terms and fees, as well as better alternatives for getting cash quickly.
How a cash advance works

A cash advance is basically a short-term loan offered by your credit card issuer. When you take out a cash advance, you’re borrowing money against your card’s line of credit. You can typically get a cash advance in a few different ways:

    At an ATM: If you have a PIN for your credit card, you can go to an ATM and get a cash advance. If you don’t have a PIN, you can request one from your card issuer. Note that it may take a few business days to receive a PIN, and there are often limits to the amount of cash you can withdraw from an ATM.
    In person: Visit your bank and request a cash advance with your credit card.
    Convenience check: Your credit card may have come with convenience checks, which can be used to write a check to yourself. You can then cash it or deposit it.
